## Biome Coaching Agent

AI-powered fitness form coaching that analyzes workout videos and delivers precise, encouraging cues to improve technique and prevent injuries. Built with ADK for speed, reliability, and extensibility — optimized for a great hackathon demo.

### TL;DR (Elevator Pitch)
Biome is your AI form coach. Upload a short workout video; in seconds, Biome flags issues (with frame numbers), scores your form, and suggests focused corrections. It’s like having a coach in your pocket.

### Problem
Most people train without a coach. Poor form causes plateaus and injuries, and current tools don’t give actionable, frame-specific guidance.

### Solution
Biome extracts pose landmarks, computes key joint angles, and produces specific cues and recommendations mapped to severity — fast enough for live demos.

### What’s Novel
- Frame-specific coaching cues tied to quantified joint-angle metrics
- Lightweight, local-first demo flow that works reliably at hackathons
- Schema-first design for results, issues, metrics, and user progress

### Important Dates (from rules)
- Contest period: Opens Oct 6, 2025; closes Nov 10, 2025 at 5:00 PM PT
- Judging: Nov 10 – Dec 5, 2025
- Winners announced: ~Dec 12, 2025

### Deploy to Cloud Run
Prereqs: gcloud CLI, a Google Cloud project, and Artifact Registry enabled.

```bash
# Build container image
gcloud builds submit --tag "gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/biome-agent"

# Deploy to Cloud Run (Service)
gcloud run deploy biome-agent \
  --image "gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/biome-agent" \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --port 8080

# Set required env vars
gcloud run services update biome-agent \
  --region us-central1 \
  --update-env-vars DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
```

Notes:
- For HTTP serving, expose a small FastAPI/ASGI entrypoint or use `adk api_server biome_coaching_agent` wrapped by a server in the container. Ensure the container listens on `$PORT`.
- For batch processing, optionally add a Cloud Run Job that triggers `extract_pose_landmarks` on queued sessions.

---

## Architecture Overview
- `root_agent` orchestrates a two-step tool flow: upload → pose extraction.
- `upload_video` validates and stores a file, creates an `analysis_sessions` row.
- `extract_pose_landmarks` uses MediaPipe + OpenCV to compute joint angles, aggregates metrics, and returns per-frame data.
- PostgreSQL stores sessions, results, and insights defined in `schema.sql`.

---

## Repository Structure
- `biome_coaching_agent/agent.py`: Root ADK agent (`root_agent`) and tool wiring
- `biome_coaching_agent/tools/upload_video.py`: Video upload + session creation
- `db/connection.py`: PostgreSQL connection utilities
- `schema.sql`: Full database schema + seed data

---

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 14+ running locally
- Windows PowerShell (this repo tested on Windows 10+)

Optional but recommended (per ADK docs):
- `uv` package manager for fast env + dependency management

---

---

## Setup

### 1) Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/biome_agent.git
cd biome_agent
```

### 2) Python environment
Using uv (recommended):
```bash
uv venv --python "python3.11" .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows PowerShell
uv pip install -U pip
uv pip install -r requirements.txt  # if you add one
```

Or with plain venv/pip:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3) Database
Create a database and apply schema:
```bash
# In psql:
CREATE DATABASE biome_coaching;
\c biome_coaching;
\i schema.sql;
```

Configure connection (optional). By default, the app uses:
```
postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/biome_coaching
```

Override via environment variable:
```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>/biome_coaching"
```

---

## Run

### 🌟 **Recommended: Full Stack Mode (Frontend + Backend)**

**Best for demos, testing, and development:**

```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Backend
python api_server.py

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
npm start
```

Then visit: **http://localhost:3000**

### 🔧 **Alternative: ADK-Only Mode**

This project follows ADK's agent discovery convention. The root agent lives at `biome_coaching_agent/agent.py` and exports `root_agent`.

Common options:
- ADK Web UI
```bash
adk web biome_coaching_agent
```

- CLI interactive
```bash
adk run biome_coaching_agent
```

- API server (basic)
```bash
adk api_server biome_coaching_agent
```

**Note:** The custom `api_server.py` is preferred over `adk api_server` for frontend integration as it includes video upload endpoints and CORS configuration.

---

## Demo Flow (Hackathon-Friendly)
1) Start the agent (Web UI or CLI)
2) Upload a small test video (≤100MB; supported: .mp4, .mov, .avi, .webm)
3) The agent will:
   - Store the file in `uploads/` with a generated session ID
   - Create an `analysis_sessions` record with status `processing`
   - Proceed with pose extraction and analysis (tooling hooks set up)
4) Review results: issues, metrics, strengths, recommendations are persisted for visualization

Note: The local demo uses simple file copy for uploads and assumes a reachable PostgreSQL.

### 2-Minute Judge Demo Script
1. Open ADK Web: `adk web biome_coaching_agent`
2. Show a test squat video file (10–20s)
3. Upload via the agent UI; show immediate session ID response
4. Trigger `extract_pose_landmarks` on that session
5. Present outputs: total frames, key angle stats, and example cues
6. Explain next-step UI to visualize frame-level issues and progress over time

---

## Configuration
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (optional; has a sensible default)
- Upload directory: created automatically as `uploads/` in project root
- Max upload size: 100MB

---

## Database Schema Highlights
Key tables (see `schema.sql` for details):
- `analysis_sessions`: One per uploaded video/session
- `analysis_results`: Overall score, timing, frame count
- `form_issues`: Issue type, severity, frame range, coaching cue
- `metrics`: Named metric values and targets
- `strengths`, `recommendations`: Positive feedback and next steps

Quick apply from repo root:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d biome_coaching -f schema.sql
```

---

## Development Notes
- Agent defined in `biome_coaching_agent/agent.py` with tools: `upload_video`, `extract_pose_landmarks`, `analyze_workout_form`, `save_analysis_results`
- Database connection helper: `db/connection.py`
- Custom API server: `api_server.py` provides REST endpoints for frontend integration

---

## Troubleshooting
- Cannot connect to DB: verify Postgres is running and `DATABASE_URL` is correct.
- `psycopg` installation issues: `requirements.txt` uses `psycopg[binary]>=3.1.0` for easier installation.
- Video fails to open: confirm the file path is correct and codec is supported (mp4, mov, avi, webm).
- No person detected: try a brighter video, centered subject, and slower movement.
- Port conflicts: Backend defaults to 8080 (Cloud Run standard). For local dev, use `$env:PORT=8000`.
